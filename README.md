#### Project structure and usage:
This project contains 10 folders, one for each week. Description and instructions can be found in each week's README.md file.

In each folder, there are four subfolders: code, data, results, sandbox. Code stores all the codes written for each week's practicals. Data stores all the data needed to run the scripts stored in code. Results store the output of coding scripts. Sandbox is used for experimental purposes and is left empty.

###### Coding scripts and data stored in the weekly folders:
Week 1: For week 1 practicals -- including UNIX, shell scripts, LaTeX
Week 2: For week 2 practicals -- Python scripts
Week 3: For week 3 practicals -- R
