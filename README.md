# My CMEE CourseWork Repository

This repository contains all coursework for the computing component of Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) Master's Course.
Instructions to run the codes can be found [here](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html).
Data required to run the coding scripts can be downloaded from the following [repository](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio).
******************
#### Languages:
bash version 3.2.57(1)

Please also refer to the README.md in each week's folder for specific languages applicable for that week.

Note that in order to run most of the R scripts, it is expected that your RStudio has installed certain packages (including but not limited to ). Please refer to each R script for the full list of packages required.
