#### Project structure and usage:
This project contains four folders: code, data, results, sandbox; and a README file.

Code stores all the codes written for GIS week practicals. Data stores all the data needed to run the scripts stored in code. Note that data is kept empty as the datafiles are too large to be uploaded on GitHub. Please refer to the start of this README for instructions on downloading relevant data files. Results store the output of coding scripts. Sandbox is used for experimental purposes and is left empty.

###### Files in code:
