# CMEE CourseWork Week 3

This repository contains codes and data for Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) week 3 coursework.
Instructions to run the codes can be found [here](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html).

Data required to run the coding scripts can be downloaded from the following [repository](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio).

***

#### Languages:
R version 3.6.3

RStudio 2021.09.0

***********
#### Dependencies:
A UNIX based Operating System is needed to run the projects. Linux and Mac OS are both possible options. Linux Ubuntu can be downloaded [here](https://ubuntu.com/)


******************
#### Installation:

###### R version 3.6.3 for MacOS can be installed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
###### R version 3.6.3 for Linux can be installed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)

#### Project structure and usage:
This project contains five folders: code, data, results, sandbox, writeup; and a README file.

Code stores all the codes written for week 3 practicals. Data stores all the data needed to run the scripts stored in code. Results store the output of coding scripts. Sandbox is used for experimental purposes and is left empty. Writeup stores the report for TAutoCorr in pdf format.
