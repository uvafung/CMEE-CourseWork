# CMEE CourseWork Week 2

This repository contains codes and data for Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) week 2 coursework.
Instructions to run the codes can be found [here](https://mhasoba.github.io/TheMulQuaBio/intro.html).

Data required to run the coding scripts can be downloaded from the following [repository](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio).

***

#### Languages:
Python 3.9.7

***********
#### Dependencies:
A UNIX based Operating System is needed to run the projects. Linux and Mac OS are both possible options. Linux Ubuntu can be downloaded [here](https://ubuntu.com/)

#### Installation:

###### Install Python 3.9.7 can be installed [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)

#### Project structure and usage:
This project contains four folder: code, data, results, sandbox; and a README file.

Code stores all the codes written for week 2 practicals. Data stores all the data needed to run the scripts stored in code. Results store the output of coding scripts. Sandbox is used for experimental purposes and is left empty.
