# CMEE MiniProject

This repository contains codes and data for Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) MiniProject.


Data required to run the coding scripts can be downloaded from the following [repository](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio).

***

#### Languages:
R version 3.6.3

#### Interactive interface:
RStudio 2021.09.0

***********
#### Dependencies and special packages:

#### Project structure and usage:
This project contains four folders: code, data, results, sandbox; and a README file.

Code stores all the codes written for the MiniProject. Data stores all the data needed to run the scripts stored in code. Results store the output of coding scripts. Sandbox is used for experimental purposes and is left empty.

###### Files in code:

    Python scripts --
        LV1.py: produce consumer resource dynamics figures
        oaks_debugme.py: runs a function that finds and returns oak species, with unit testing
        profileme.py: profiling code to speed up computational process
        profileme2.py: faster code profiling
        TestR.py: test the process of running R scripts from Python
        timeitme.py: compares the speed of loops, list comprehensions and join methods for strings

    R script --
        TestR.R: run by TestR.py to test running R scripts from Python

    Jupyter notebook --
        MyFirstJupyterNb.ipynb: running Python and R commands with Jupyter Notebook



###### Files in data:
    TestOaksData.csv
